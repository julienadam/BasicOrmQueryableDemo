## Description

This little project is intended for demo and learning  purposes.

It is more or less the same code than what is available at the end of step 2 of the *Building an IQueryable provider* MSDN series, very slightly refactored.

## Requirements

- Needs a Northwind database
- If you don't have one, I made a script available on Gist here : https://gist.githubusercontent.com/julienadam/ffbd85bf941ca83ef7c709c7cc7a627f/raw/northwind.sql
- Run that on a SQL Server engine and modify the connection string in the code if necessary
